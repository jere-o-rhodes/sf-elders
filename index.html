            <h1>Project Title</h1>
            <h3> In 1961, Illinois <a  href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/illinois.htm&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1682918171069319&usg=AOvVaw1swbEtYJTNKyFV_wRctMC5" class="italics">became </a> the first state in the country to decriminalize sodomy – ironically, this was 64 years after Illinois made history by becoming the first state to recognize fellatio as an act of sodomy.  </h3>

            <h3> After the decision, there were various court cases across the country from that time on that debated the legality of gay sexual activity and whether the courts had the right to pass legislation that would criminalize private, consensual sex.  </h3>


            <h3>Despite the landmark nature of the decision in Illinois, it wasn’t until 2003 that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lawrence_v._texas#:~:text=Overview-,Lawrence%20v.,State%20and%20United%20States%20territory." class="italics"> Lawrence v. Texas</a>, a case involving two men engaging in consensual sex and made its way all the way to the Supreme Court, made same-sex sexual activity legal in every US state.  </h3>

            <h3> In 2016, <a href= "https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-556" class="italics"> Obergefell v. Hodges </a> held that the state can not discriminate on the basis of sex when issuing marriage licenses, legalizing marriages that weren’t between a man and woman. </h3>

            <h3> Between 1961 and now, various US states have enacted various legislation related to hate crimes on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, the AIDS crisis continues to rip through various LGBTQIA+ communities across the country and many states are currently enacting legislation limiting the rights of trans Americans.</h3>

            <h3> Through everything, millennials and gen-z are some of the first generations in US history to have a community of queer elders to know, love and look up to. </h3>

            <h3> This project, produced by students of UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism, tells the story of some of the San Francisco Bay Area’s queer elders and the wisdom they have to teach younger generations of LGBTQIA+ people. </h3>
