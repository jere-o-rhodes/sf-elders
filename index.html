            <h1>Project Title</h1>
            <h3> The San Francisco Bay Area is home to some of the nation’s richest histories of queer and trans activism. From the election of Harvey Milk to the SF Board of Supervisors to ACT UP/Golden Gate, the Bay has always been viewed as a centerpoint in the battle for queer rights. </h3>

            <h3> Despite the ubiquity of some of the larger points in that history, there are so many people, both past and present, who have made contributions to the past, present and future of queerness, both in the Bay and nationwide. </h3>


            <h3>This project, created by students of UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism’s class of 2024, aims to highlight just a few of those figures. </h3>
